# Cave and Cave-Plus archives

# What is this?

Cave (and later Cave-Plus) were MUDs for the [BBC Micro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Micro), initially released back in 1985.

This repository contains original dumps of the source code (from a few different places).  I make no claims whatsoever regarding the copyright.

# Source in Text

The original BBC BASIC files have been detokenised, thanks to ```BBCBasicToText.py``` which is in the scripts directory.  Please note that this needs Python2 to work correctly.

# The remake

You don't need the original hardware (including Econet!) to enjoy Cave.  I put together a remodelling using the Ranvier MUD system: https://github.com/tgreaves/cave-bbc-econet
